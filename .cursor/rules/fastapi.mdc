- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Keep route handlers clean and delegate business logic to services
- Use dependency injection for services and database connections
- Document API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger comments
- API endpoints use a global prefix of '/v1'
